## Swift Matrix Library
Swift is a high level language that is asking for some numerical library to
perform computation *fast*, or at the very least *easily*. This is a bare-bones
wrapper for that library.

This library is hacked together and not as complete as it should be. This
library was programmed in two days to see what's possible and does not hook in
with the Accelerate framework.

Currently, this library gives you

* easy initializers for 1D and 2D arrays
* nice operators
* various functions (sin, abs, pow, etc) that operate on entire arrays

This library inherits heavily from NumPy. The syntax and operators are similar.
When in doubt about what a function does, look at NumPy's docs (although swix's
docs are included in the wiki).

## Usage
1. Download this repo.
2. Include the folder `swix` in your project.

Boom. Done. 

The operators for `Array[]()` have been overwritten and Swift works
like you'd expect it to. This is a bug -- I want to preserve Array as is.

#### Functions
If you have a function that operates on a single element, it can easily be
applied to the entire array through `apply_function(single_element_function,
matrix2d`

You can see the wiki for a complete list of functions, but this library
implements basic functions such as sin, abs while getting into slightly more
complex norm functions.

This library also can do FFTs.

#### Init'ing arrays
```swift
ones(4) = [1, 1, 1, 1]
ones((4,4)) = matrix([1, 1],
                     [1, 1])
// same with zeros
array(1, 2, 3, 4) = [1, 2, 3, 4]
array("[1 2; 4 5]") = matrix([1 2],
                             [4 5])
```


#### Arithmetic
```swift
ones(4) * 4 = [4, 4, 4, 4]
ones(4) * (zeros(4) + 2) = [2, 2, 2, 2]

// same for +, -, *, /
```

Note that `*` is not a dot product operator.  I would have used `@` as a dot
product operator (like [PEP 465][pep], but custom operators [can't use `@`][@].
So, I decided to use the symbol for extra-important multiplication: `*!`.

## Features to be added
* FFT
* BLAS calling/C integration
* better complex number integration
