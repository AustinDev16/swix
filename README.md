## Swift Matrix Library
Apple's Swift is a high level language that's *asking* for some numerical
library to perform computation *fast* or at the very least *easily*. This is a
bare-bones wrapper for that library.

A way to have iOS run matlab-like code is something I've been waiting for, and
am incredibly excited to see the results. This will make porting complex signal
processing algorithms to C *much* easier. Porting from MATLAB to C was (and is)
a pain in the butt, and this library aims to make the MATLAB to iOS conversion
*simple.*

As an example, here's some relatively simple Objective-C sample code:

```objc
void add_two_vectors(double * x, double * y, double * result, int N){
    // functions can be sped up with blas/lapack, the reason it's a function
    for (int i=0; i<N; i++){
        result[i] = x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
void add_scalar(double x, double * y, double * result, int N){
    for (int i=0; i<N; i++){
        result[i] = x + y[i];
    }
}
void multiply_two_vectors(double * x, double * y, double * result, int N){
    for (int i=0; i<N; i++){
        result[i] = x[i] * y[i];
    }
}
void set_value(double value, double * x, int N){
    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) x[i] = value;
}
void main(){
    int N = 10;
    double * x = (double *)malloc(sizeof(double) * N);
    double * y = (double *)malloc(sizeof(double) * N);
    double * intermediate = (double *)malloc(sizeof(double) * N);
    double * result = (double *)malloc(sizeof(double) * N);

    set_value(3.142, x, N);
    set_value(1.618, y, N);
    add_two_vectors(x, y, intermediate, N);
    add_scalar(4, x, x, N);
    multiply_two_vectors(x, intermediate, result, N);
}
```

The equivalent Swift syntax with this library?

```swift
let N = 10
var x = ones(N) * pi
var y = ones(N) * phi
var result = (x+y+4)*x
```

While this library is basic, I expect something like [NumPy][numpy] to be
released: a mathematical library that includes more than you would ever
possibly need. 

In most cases, this library calls [Accelerate][accel] or [OpenCV][opencv]. I
optimized what I needed to be fast, meaning all operators and select
mathematical functions are fast while the functions I didn't need are slow. If
you want to speed up some function or add add another feature in those
libraries, feel free to submit a pull request (preferred!) or contact me at
[@stsievert][st] or [sieve121@umn.edu](mailto:sieve121@umn.edu).

Currently, this library gives you

* operators (+, etc) and various functions (sin, etc) that operate on entire arrays
* easy initializers for 1D and 2D arrays
* dot product, matrix inversion, solution to linear system of equations
* machine learning algorithms (SVM, kNN, SVD/PCA, more to come)
* One dimensional Fourier transforms

When I was crafting this library, I primarily followed the footsteps and
example set by [NumPy][numpy]. For the more complex mathematical functions
(e.g., SVD) I tested it against NumPy. Matlab, at least for the SVD, returns
different output.

## Documentation 
Details on how to install and individual functions can be found in [swix's
documentation][swix-doc]

## Third Party Frameworks/Libraries
* [Accelerate][accel]
* [OpenCV][opencv]
* [swix-complex][complex]
* [ScalarArithemetic][scalar]

## Features to be added
* Further Accelerate integration. The basics are down and the actual work needs
  to be done.
* `x[0..<4] = 1`. I tried implementing this but had to add some annoying types;
  `var y:matrix = x[0..<5]`. I'll leave it be for now.
