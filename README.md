## Swift Matrix Library
Apple's Swift is a high level language that's *asking* for some numerical
library to perform computation *fast* or at the very least *easily*. This is a
bare-bones wrapper for that library.

A way to have iOS run matlab-like code is something I've been waiting for, and
am incredibly excited to see the results. This will make porting complex signal
processing algorithms to C *much* easier. Porting from MATLAB to C was (and is)
a pain in the ass, and this library aims to make the MATLAB to iOS conversion
*simple.*

As an example, here's some relatively simple Objective-C sample code:

```objc
void add_two_vectors(double * x, double * y, double * result, int N){
    // can be sped up with accelerate, the reason it's a function
    for (int i=0; i<N; i++){
        result[i] = x[i] + y[i];
    }
}
void add_scalar(double x, double * y, double * result, int N){
    for (int i=0; i<N; i++){
        result[i] = x + y[i];
    }
}
void multiply_two_vectors(double * x, double * y, double * result, int N){
    for (int i=0; i<N; i++){
        result[i] = x[i] * y[i];
    }
}
void main(){
    int N = 10;
    double * x = (double *)malloc(sizeof(double) * N);
    double * y = (double *)malloc(sizeof(double) * N);
    double * intermediate = (double *)malloc(sizeof(double) * N);
    double * result = (double *)malloc(sizeof(double) * N);
    for (int i=0; i<N; i++){
        x[i] = 3;
        y[i] = 1.618;
    }
    add_two_vectors(x, y, intermediate, N);
    add_scalar(4, x, x, N);
    multiply_two_vectors(x, intermediate, result, N);
}
```

The equivalent Swift syntax with this library?

```swift
let N = 10
var x = ones(N) * 3
var y = ones(N) * phi
var result = (x+y+4)*x
```

While this library is basic, I expect something like [NumPy][numpy] to be
released: a mathematical library that includes more than you would ever
possibly need. In most cases, this library just wraps Swift.  However, in other
cases it calls the [Accelerate framework][accel] or [OpenCV][opencv]. If you
want to add a feature, feel free to submit a pull request.

Currently, this library gives you

* easy initializers for 1D and 2D arrays
* various functions (sin, etc) and operators (+, etc) that operate on entire arrays
* dot product
* machine learning algorithms (SVM, kNN, PCA, more to come)
* FFT/IFFT

When I was crafting this library, I primarily depended on [NumPy][numpy]. The
syntax and operators are relatively similar, so if you're in doubt on how to
use a function, just look at NumPy's docs or [swix's docs in the wiki][swix-doc]

## Third Party Frameworks/Libraries
* [Accelerate][accel]
* [OpenCV][opencv]
* [swix-complex][complex]
* [ScalarArithemetic][scalar]

## Usage
1. Download this repo.
2. Include the folder `swix` in your project.
3. Include the declarations in `swix/objc/swift-Bridging-Header.h` in your
   project. You can add these to your own bridging header and changing the
   paths or [modify your xcode project][br-he] to make that the bridging
   header.
4. (optional) [Set the compiler optimization flag][setting] to `-O` or `-Ofast`, which can
   lead to [large speed gains][comp].

Boom. Done. 

The operators for Array have been persevered and new operators are defined for
the `matrix` and `matrix2d` class.


#### Functions
If you have a function that operates on a single element, it can easily be
applied to the entire array through `apply_function(single_element_function,
matrix2d`

You can see the wiki for a complete list of functions, but this library
implements basic functions such as sin, abs while getting into slightly more
complex norm functions.

This library also can do one dimensional FFTs.

#### Init'ing arrays
```swift
ones(4) ~== matrix([1, 1, 1, 1])
ones((4,4)) ~== matrix([1, 1],
                      [1, 1])
// same with zeros
array(1, 2, 3, 4) ~== [1, 2, 3, 4]
array("[1 2; 4 5]") ~== matrix([1 2],
                              [4 5])
```

#### Arithmetic
```swift
// same for +, -, *, /, etc
ones(4) * 4 ~== [4, 4, 4, 4]
ones(4) * (zeros(4) + 2) ~== [2, 2, 2, 2]
Int(3) + Double(3.14) == 6.14 // through ScalarArithmetic
```

Note that `*` is not a dot product operator.  I would have used `@` as a dot
product operator (like [PEP 465][pep], but custom operators [can't use `@`][@].
So, I decided to use the symbol for extra-important multiplication: `*!`.

## Features to be added
* `x[0..<4] = 1`. I tried implementing this but had to add some annoying types;
  `var y:matrix = x[0..<5]`. I'll leave it be for now.
* Reintegrate machine learning functions (using `double *`!)
* Further Accelerate integration. The basics are down and the actual work needs
  to be done.
