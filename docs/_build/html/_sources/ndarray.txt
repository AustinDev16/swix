Array
=============

This stands for ":math:`N` dimensional array". It's a mix of programming
language and math language; in math, this is called a vector.

The full docs can be found below but I'll touch on some highlights:

* operators. All arithmetic operators and a host of comparison operators work element-wise
* easy initializers (ones, zeros, zeros_like, linspace, etc)
* simple math. Math that applies to each element.
* nice indexing, including accessing multiple elements at once (goodbye for loops!).

.. note:: ``*`` is an element-wise multiplication. ``*!`` is used for a dot product or matrix multiplication. Not like matlab!
