Welcome to swix's documentation!
================================

The goal of swix is to ease the Python/Matlab-C conversion. It does not aim to
allow easy development, meaning that there are still areas where the ease could
be improved (e.g., ``x[0..<2] = zeros(2)``). Regardless, this library provides
almost a one-to-one conversion between Matlab and Swift.

This library wraps `OpenCV`_ and through this integrates the ObjC, ObjC++, C++,
C and Swift languages.

This library is optimized through the `Accelerate framework`_ in some cases.
Notable areas that need to be optimized and not depend on native Swift
for-loops are

* element-wise division and multiplication, for ``Double * matrix``, ``matrix *
  matrix`` and ``matrix * Double`` including ``> < <= >= %``
* argwhere
* basically all simple math operators (sin, abs, cos, round, randn, cumsum, norm, variance...)

For a speed comparison, in the real-world example I used I found that on the
computer, this library was ~3-4x slower than Matlab. Going down to iOS resulted
in another speed drop of ~10x, meaning iOS is very roughly 30-40 times slower
than Matlab.
