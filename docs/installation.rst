Installation
=============
1. Download `the repo`_ or `this file`_
2. Include the folder ``swix/swix/swix/swix`` in your project.
3. Modify your XCode bridging header to include the C functions. This can mean
   either copying swix's bridging header to your bridging header or `modify
   your Xcode project`_ to find swix's header.
4. (optional) Change `your compiler optimization flag`_ which can lead to
   `incredible speed gains`_. Be careful -- this skips ``assert``. I would
   recommend testing with ``-Onone`` before switching.
5. (optional) If you plan on using ``read_csv, write_csv, savefig, imshow`` you need to
   change the ``S2_PREFIX`` in ``numbers.swift``. This should point to the swix
   folder; something like ``the/path/to/yourXcodeProjectName/swix/``
