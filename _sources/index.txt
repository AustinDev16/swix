   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to swix's documentation!
================================
The explicit goal of swix is to allow easy *conversion* (and not easy
developement) between a complicated signal processing algorithm and a mobile
app. Converting from Python/Matlab to C was (and is) a pain. I would certainly
like to see more mobile apps and hope this will help.

This function relies on NumPy and implements the most basic usage. If in doubt
about a function, look at NumPy's docs for a function of the same name; I tried
to include links.

This library is optimized through the `Accelerate framework`_ in most cases.
All operations and the important operations (well, the ones I used) are
optimized through this framework. And luckily, examples exist in swix on how to
call C functions.

For a speed comparison, in the real-world example I used I found that on the
computer, this library was ~2-3x slower than Matlab. Going down to iOS resulted
in another speed drop of ~10x, meaning iOS is very roughly 20-30 times slower
than Matlab. Not bad for an underpowered mobile device!

Examples are perhaps the most useful aspect of documentation, so I've included
some examples in :doc:`examples`

There exist two versions of these docs. There is a `mobile friendly`_ version on
readthedocs and `another version`_ on scottsievert.github.io/swix. The version on
readthedocs is mobile friendly but out of date; the other version is easier to
maintain.
